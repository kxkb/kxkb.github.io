Запуск виртуальной машины.  
 
```shell
$ qemu-system-i386 options disk_image
```

Finally, 'w'rite the result to the file: you are done. You now have a partition you can mount directly from your host, as well as part of a QEMU disk image
 
```shell
$ qemu-system-i386 -hdc /dev/md0 [...] 
```

You can, of course, safely set any bootloader on this disk image using QEMU, provided the original /dev/hdaN partition contains the necessary tools.
